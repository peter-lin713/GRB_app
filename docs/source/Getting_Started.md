# Getting Started

Redshift-Estimator (X-Ray) is written in R and relies on the [Streamlit]([https://pytorch.org/](https://streamlit.io/)) and Python for its GUI Web app.

## Installation

To set up the project and ensure all dependencies are installed, ensure that you have access to
* **R** (version >= 4.3) with RStudio
* **Python** (version >= 3.11)

1. Locally clone the project repository from GitHub or directly download the .zip file:
```
git clone https://github.com/gammarayapp/GRB-Web-App.git 
```

2. Install the necessary R packages, open and run `Package_install.Rmd` in RStudio. Alternatively, use the `install.packages()` command in R with `packages.txt` and `https://cran.r-project.org` as the base URL of repositories.

This project also requires the Python libraries **Streamlit**, **Pandas**, and **Pillow**, which can be installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Please copy out all the R files from the script folder to the working directory where app.py is present before running the webapp.
