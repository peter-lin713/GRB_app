# Usage
On this page, we go over the most important user-facing functions that the Redshift-Estimator (X-ray) web app has and what each of these functions does. Read this page carefully to understand the various arguments/options that can be set while using these functions.


As discussed in [Getting Started](./Getting_Started.md), copy the files and run the app.py file in an IDE (preferably, VSCode) and write the following in the terminal: 
```streamlit run app.py```

Below is the illustration of our web app interface showing how it works.
